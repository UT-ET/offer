Quickly *offer* a file for download on LAN.

Usage
-----

::

    pip install git+https://github.com/musically-ut/offer.git

Then you can use it from the CLI:

::

    offer ~/path/file.ext

It'll try to host the file on port ``80`` by default and will fall back on port
``8000`` silently if it is not run with the correct permissions. You can provide
a custom port via the ``--port`` argument.
